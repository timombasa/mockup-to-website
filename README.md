mockup-to-website
=================

Practising using markup and styling to convert mockups to websites...down to the last pixel.

Inspired by version 2 of Project 1 in Udacity's Front-End Web Dev. Nanodegree.

I was provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. 
I will develop a responsive website that will display an image and text.
